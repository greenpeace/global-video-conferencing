### Follow the three golden rules! (one person breaking them can ruin the call for all)

* **Always wear a headset:** This stops echo. The attached microphone stops background noise and the sound of your computer's fan, hard disk and keyboard tapping. iPhone-style "string" and bluetooth sets give poor quality audio.
* **Use in a quiet area or keep on mute:** Background noise causes fatigue, and more than one person with background noise can easily stop anyone hearing anything.
* **Make a test call:** A slow connection or a connection filled with too much traffic from other people (or other software on your computer) will make your sound and video choppy and hard to hear and see. A meeting ID will work even before your meeting takes place, use it and see if you see your picture shown unbroken back to you.

### More tips
* Use mobile data if you have an app to track your data usage or else it gets expensive
* To be seen clearly, have good lighting behind the camera or to the side, not behind you!
* Touching or playing with your microphone will flood the call with noise
* Always use a video conference room instead of your computer when available
