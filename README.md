Zoom video conferencing software will let you access Greenpeace virtual conferences.

### Always follow the three golden rules
(just one person breaking them can ruin the call for everyone)

## Rule 1: Always wear a headset
The headphone part stops echo. The attached microphone stops background noise and the sound of your computer's fan, hard disk and keyboard tapping. iPhone-style "string" headsets are very poor quality.

## Rule 2: Use in a quiet area or keep on mute
Background noise causes fatigue, and more than one person with background noise can easily stop anyone hearing anything.

## Rule 3: Make a test call
A slow connection or a connection filled with too much traffic from other people (or other software on your computer) will make your sound and video choppy and hard to hear and see. Your box number will work even before your meeting takes place, so you can use it and see if you see your picture shown unbroken back to you.

## More tips
* Older wifi routers cause big problems for video conferencing. Please either use a network cable
or upgrade to modern 5GHz wifi to avoid congestion that causes picture and audio distortion
* Only use it on 4G/LTE mobile data if you have an app to track your data usage or else it gets expensive
* To be seen clearly, have good lighting behind the camera or to the side, not behind you!
* Touching or playing with your microphone will flood the call with noise
* If you don't have a webcam yet, Global IT recommend a Logitech HD Pro C920
* Always use a video conference room instead of your computer when available
