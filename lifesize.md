### Three golden rules to follow during your meetings

1. **Always wear a headset** to prevent echo. The attached microphone stops background noise (like your computer's fan, hard disk or keyboard tapping). iPhone-style "string" and bluetooth sets give poor quality audio.
2. **Use in a quiet area or keep on mute.** Background noise causes fatigue, and more than one person with background noise can easily stop anyone hearing anything.
3. **Make a test call.** A slow connection or a connection filled with too much traffic can compromise your sound and video quality. A meeting ID will work even before your meeting takes place, use it to check if your image shown unbroken back to you.

#### Good to know
* One person breaking the above rules can ruin the call for all!
* Use **Gallery View** when there is no presentation so that you can see others in the call
* To be seen clearly, have **good lighting behind the camera** or to the side, not behind you!
* Keep pressing spacebar for as long as you need to speak. This will temporarily unmute you.
* Touching or playing with your microphone will flood the call with noise
* Use mobile data if you have an app to track your data usage or else it gets expensive
