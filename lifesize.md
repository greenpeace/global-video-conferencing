| Since **November 4th** LifeSize is no longer available in Video Conferencing rooms as default functionality. If you need to join a Lifesize call you can use the Lifesize app on your machine. Lifesize numbers will no longer be accessible from December 1st. | To avoid issues with meetings make sure to update them in your calendar. Remove Lifesize box numbers and [add Zoom meeting IDs](https://support.greenpeace.org/support/collaboration/video-conferencing/using-zoom#create-a-meeting). |
