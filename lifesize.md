| Lifesize Video Conferencing        |
|:-----------------------------------|
| We are **transitioning video conferencing systems*** from LifeSize to **Zoom**. On November 4th you will no longer be able to use LifeSize in Video Conferencing rooms. To avoid issues make sure to update meetings in your calendars to remove any Lifesize box numbers and [add a Zoom meeting ID](https://support.greenpeace.org/support/collaboration/video-conferencing/using-zoom#create-a-meeting).|
|Do you **need to use LifeSize** before the final switch? [Visit this page](http://vc.greenpeace.org/lifesize)        |

### Three golden rules to follow

1. **Always wear a headset** to prevent echo. The attached microphone stops background noise (like your computer's fan, hard disk or keyboard tapping). iPhone-style "string" and bluetooth sets give poor quality audio.
2. **Use in a quiet area or keep on mute.** Background noise causes fatigue, and more than one person with background noise can easily stop anyone hearing anything.
3. **Make a test call.** A slow connection or a connection filled with too much traffic can compromise your sound and video quality. A meeting ID will work even before your meeting takes place, use it to check if your image shown unbroken back to you.

#### Good to know
* One person breaking the above rules can ruin the call for all!
* Use **Gallery View** when there is no presentation so that you can see others in the call
* To be seen clearly, have **good lighting behind the camera** or to the side, not behind you!
* Touching or playing with your microphone will flood the call with noise
* Use mobile data if you have an app to track your data usage or else it gets expensive
