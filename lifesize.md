### Lifesize is replaced by Zoom 
Since **November 4th** LifeSize is no longer available in Video Conferencing rooms as default functionality. If you still want to join a Lifesize call **use the Lifesize app** on your machine. Lifesize numbers will no longer be accessible from December 1st.

### Update meetings in your calendars
To avoid issues with meetings make sure to update them in your calendar. Remove Lifesize box numbers and [add Zoom meeting IDs](https://support.greenpeace.org/support/collaboration/video-conferencing/using-zoom#create-a-meeting).
